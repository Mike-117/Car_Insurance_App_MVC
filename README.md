# Car Insurance Application

This is an ASP.NET Web Application using MVC architecture. It is designed to select a user's eligibility for car insurance. When the program is run, a user is presented a form asking for, among other things, the user's age, whether they have a dui, and how many speeding tickets they have received. It also asks about their car and what kind of coverage they are interested in.

The program checks whether the user qualifies for insurance or not. For those who qualify, I created an algorithm which takes all their inputs and determines how much they will be charged for insurance. The resultant quote is displayed on a separate page.
